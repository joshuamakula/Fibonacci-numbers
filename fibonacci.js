  Fibonacci numbers are numbers obtained by adding the two previous numbers in the sequence to obtain the next higher number.
  Example: 1+1= 2, 2+3= 5, 5+8= 13...
  The formula is: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

      return 1;
    
  // Next fibonacci number = previous + one before previous
    return fibonacci(number - 1) + fibonacci(number - 2);
  }
  console.log(fibonacci(1));
